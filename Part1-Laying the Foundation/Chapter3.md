# Measure Twice, Cut Once: Upstream Prerequisites

Before beginning construction of a house, a builder reviews blueprints, checks that all permits have been obtained. No matter what the project, the preparation is tailored to the project's specific needs and done before construction begin.

This chapter describes the work that must be done to prepare for software construction.

## 1. Importance of Prerequisites

If you start the process with designs for a Pontiac aztek, you can test it all you want to, and it will never turn into a Rolls-Royce. If you want a Rolls-Royce, you have to plan from the beginning. In software development, you do such planning when you define the problem, when you specify the solution and when you design the solution.

The rest of the section describes in detail why proper preparation is important and tells you how to determine whether you are ready for begin construction.

The goal of preparation is risk reduction. A good project planner clears major risks out of the way as early as possible.

Preparation for construction is not an exact science. Details can vary greatly among projects.

## 2. Determine the Kind of Software You are Working On

40 different methods for gathering requirements, 
50 variations in working on software design, 300 kinds of testing applied to projects in more than 700 different programming languages.

Different kinds of software projects call for different balances between preparation and construction. Every project is unique. 

## 3. Problem-Definition Prerequisite

The problem definition lays down the foundation for the rest of programming process. The problem definition should be in user language, and it should be described from the user's point of view.

Be sure you know what you are aiming at before you start.

The penalty for failing to define the problem is that you can waste a lot of time solving the wrong problem. Actually this is a double penalty because you have a wrong problem solution and you did not resolve the actual problem yet.

## 4. Requirements Prerequisite

Requirements describe in detail what a software system is supposed to do, and they are the first step toward a solution. The requirements activity is also known as "requirements development", "requirements analysis", "analysis", "requirement definition", "software requirements", "specification", "functional spec." and "spec."

### Handling Requirements Changes During Construction
here are several things you can do to make the best of changing requirements during construction;

* Use the requirements checklist at the end of the section to assess the quality your requirements
* Make sure everyone knows the cost of requirement changes
* Set up a change-control procedure
* Use development approaches that accommodate changes
* Dump the project
* Keep your eye on the business case for the project

## 5. Architecture Prerequisite

Software architecture is the high-level part of software design. Architecture is also known as "system architecture," "high-level design," and "top-level design". 

Good architecture makes construction easy. Bad architecture makes construction almost impossible. Without a good software architecture, you may have the right problem but the wrong solution. 

Architectural changes are expensive to make during construction or later.

### Typical Architecture Components

* Program Organization
* Major Classes
* Data design
* Business Rules
* User Interface Design
* Resource Management
* Security
* Performance
* Scalability
* Interoperability
* Internationalization/Localization
* Input/Output
* Error Processing
* Fault Tolerance
* Architectural Feasibility
* Overengineering
* Buy vs. Build Decision
* Reuse decision
* Change Strategy
* General Architectural Quality

## 6. Amount of Time to Spend on Upstream Prerequisites

Amount of time to spend on problem definition, requirements, and software architecture varies according to your project. Generally a well-run project devotes about 10 to 20 percent of its effort and about 20 to 30 percent of its schedule to requirements, architecture, and up-front planning.

If requirements are unstable and you are working on a small project you will probably need to resolve requirement issues yourself.
