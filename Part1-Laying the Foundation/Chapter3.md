# Measure Twice, Cut Once: Upstream Prerequisites

Before beginning construction of a house, a builder reviews blueprints, checks that all permits have been obtained. No matter what the project, the preparation is tailored to the project's specific needs and done before construction begin.

This chapter describes the work that must be done to prepare for software construction.

## 1. Importance of Prerequisites

If you start the process with designs for a Pontiac aztek, you can test it all you want to, and it will never turn into a Rolls-Royce. If you want a Rolls-Royce, you have to plan from the beginning. In software development, you do such planning when you define the problem, when you specify the solution and when you design the solution.

The rest of the section describes in detail why proper preparation is important and tells you how to determine whether you are ready for begin construction.

The goal of preparation is risk reduction. A good project planner clears major risks out of the way as early as possible.

Preparation for construction is not an exact science. Details can vary greatly among projects.

## 2. Determine the Kind of Software You are Working On

40 different methods for gathering requirements, 
50 variations in working on software design, 300 kinds of testing applied to projects in more than 700 different programming languages.

Different kinds of software projects call for different balances between preparation and construction. Every project is unique.
