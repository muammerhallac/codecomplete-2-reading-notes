## What is Software Construction?

Developing computer software can be a complicated process. From the first computer software to now,  researchers and programmers identified distinct activities that go into software development.
They include;

* Problem definition
* Requirement development
* **Construction planning**
* Software architecture (or High-level Design)
* **Detailed design**
* **Coding and Debugging**
* **Unit Testing**
* **Integration testing**
* **Integration**
* System testing
* Corrective maintenance

This book is focuses on bold ones above and other activities roughly.

## Why is Software Construction Important?

Here is why;

* Construction is a large part of software development
* Construction is the central activity in software development
* With a focus on construction, the individual programmer's productivity can improve enormously
* Construction's product (the source code) is often the only accurate description of the software
* Construction is the only activity that is guaranteed to be done
