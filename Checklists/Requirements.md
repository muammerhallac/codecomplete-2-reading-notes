# Requirements

The requirements checklist contains a list of questions to ask yourself about your project requirements. Use the list below as a sanity check at construction time to determine how solid the ground that you are standing on is and where you are on the requirements Richter scale.

Not all of the checklist questions will apply to your project. 

## Specific Functional Requirements

* Are all the inputs to the system specified, including their source, accuracy, range of values, and frequency?
* Are all the outputs from the system specified, including their destination, accuracy, range of values, frequency and format?
* Are all output formats specified for web pages, reports and so on?
* Are all the hardware and software interfaces specified?
* Are all the external communication interfaces specified, including hard-shaking, error-checking, and communication protocols?
* Are all the tasks the user wants to perform specified?
* Is the data in each task and the data resulting from each task specified?

## Specific Nonfunctional Requirements

* Ä±s the expected response time, from the users point of view, specified  for all necessary operations?
* Are other timing considerations specified, such as processing time, data transfer rate, and the system throughput?
* Is the level of security specified?
* Are minimum machine memory and free disk space specified?
* Is the maintainability of the system specified?
* Is the definition of success included? of failure?

## Requirements Quaility

* Are the requirements written in the users language? Do the users think so?
* Does each requirement avoid conflicts with the other requirements?
* Are acceptable tradeoffs between competing attributes specified-for example, between robustness and correctness
* do the requirements avoid specifying the design?
* Are the requirements at a fairly consistent level of detail?
* Are the requirements clear enough to be turned over to an independent group for construction and still be understood?
* Is each item relevant to the problem and its solution?
* Is each requirement testable?
* Are all possible changes to the requirements specified, including the likehood of each change?

## Requirements Completeness

* Where information is not available before development begins, are the areas of incompleteness specified?
* Are the requirements complete in the sense that if the product satisfies every requirement, it will be acceptable?
* Are you comfortable with all the requirements?
